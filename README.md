# Hey there 🚀, João here.

- I'm a weird crossover of product-designer-engineer that loves spacetech and AI.

- 🤖 I’m currently building [@darkmatter](https://github.com/Darkmatter-AI)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building spacetech + AI software

- I've designed:
  - a production [sportscar](https://monte-negro.org/Draco)
  - an award-winning [3d printer](https://beeverycreative.com/product/beethefirstplus/)
  - a [code-teaching platforms](https://ubbu.io/) for kids
  - award-winning [spacesuit](https://monte-negro.org/StarKnight-Suit) for ESA
  - a [moon-base](https://monte-negro.org/Rosas-Lunar-Base-Design) made out of a Starship
  - a [reusable satellite](https://monte-negro.org/Nazare-Space-Capsule) that lands
  - and other things (visit [my website](https://monte-negro.org/))

- 👩‍🏫 I've co-founded https://github.com/ubbu-team.

- 💬 Ask me about astrodynamics, astrophysics, design, CAD modelling, UI/UX
